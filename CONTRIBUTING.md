# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing! A few quick guidelines to help make contributions easy to review and accept.

How to contribute
- Fork the repo and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-change`
- Make your changes and add tests where appropriate.
- Run the test-suite locally: `python -m pytest -q`
- Open a pull request describing the change and linking any relevant issues.

Coding style
- Follow the existing project style and keep changes small and focused.
- Use type hints where helpful and keep functions short and testable.

Tests
- Add unit tests for new behavior under `tests/`.
- CI will run pytest on each PR.

Issues & support
- If you are unsure whether a change will be accepted, open an issue first and describe your idea.

Thank you — we appreciate your help!
